# 1. Introduction

## The MERN Stack

- React: Client-Side Library
- Node: A Server-Side Runtime: JavaScript on the server side - JS outside the browser
- Express: Node JS Framework, which simplifies Server-Side Code and Logic - Middleware-based, Includes Routing, View-Rendering & More
- mongoDB: A NoSQL Database which allows us to store documents in "Collections" instead of "Records" in tables, as in SQL. Doesn't enforce a schema or relations. Great performance. Easily connected to Node/Express (Not to React!). A powerful database that can be easily integrated into a Node/Express environment.

## MERN - The Big Picture
