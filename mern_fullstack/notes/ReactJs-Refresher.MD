# React.js Refresher

## What Was It All About?

## A JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces

- Started a huge eco-system, effectively forming a "pseudo-framwork"

- We use it to build the front-end of user applications
- Uses a Declarative Approach: Define the result, not the steps that lead to the result
- Imperative Approach ("normal js) You define all the steps to achieve the result
- You define components and build your UI with these components
- You deifine the results
