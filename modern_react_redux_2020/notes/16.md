# Redux

## Redux Cycle
1. Action Creator 
2. Action (has a type: described the change and payload)
3. Dispatch (dispatch function takes an action, copies the object and passes it off to different places) 
4. Reducers (a function that takes an action and some data and returns the changed data)
5. State (a central object that contains all the data)

## Analogy with an insurance company
1. Action Creator (person dropping off the form)
2. Action (the form)
3. Dispatch (form receiver)
4. Reducers (departments)
5. State (compiled department data)
