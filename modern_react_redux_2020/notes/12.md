# The Hooks System

## Hooks System

* useState -> lets you use state in functional component
* useEffect -> lets you use something like lifecycle methods
* useRef -> lets you crate a 'ref' in a function component

Primitive Hooks
* useState
* useReducer
* useRef
* useDebugValue
* useEffect
* useCallback
* useImperativeHandle
* useContext
* useMemo
* useLayoutEffect

Custom Hook
* useTranslate, for example, could make use of useState and useEffect

* configure the hook to run some code when:
* 1. the component is rendered for the first time only: []
* 2. when it is rendered the first time and whenever it rerenders: ...nothing
* 3. when the component is rendered for the first time (and whenever it rerenders and some piece of data has changed: [data]
