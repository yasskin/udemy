## Three Tenets of Composition

1. Component Nesting
2. Component Reusability
3. Component Configuration

## Application Overview

- Semantic UI
- Provide a name for the component
- Create a new file that has the same name as the component
  - CommentDetail - uppercased
- Create a new component in the file
- Make sure the new componet is configurable

## Native Component Approach

## Specifying Images in JSX

- faker.image.avatar()

## Extracting JSX to New Components

1. Idenfity JSX that appears to be duplicated
2.

1. System for passing data from a parent component to a child component
2. Goal is to customize or configure a child component
3. Props customize how a component looks or how a user interacts with it.

## Passing and Receiving Props

1. Child cannot pass data back up to the parent.
2. Generally it is about commmunicating from parent to children

### Two Stages

1. Proide information from parent to child
