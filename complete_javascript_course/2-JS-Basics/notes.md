A Very Short History of JavaScript
1995 Launched as LiveScript
1996 Changes to JavaScript to attract Java developers
1997 ECMAScript 1 became the first standard. ECMAScript refers to the standard.
2009 ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released with lots of new features
2015 ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015) was released: the biggest update ever ES6.

ES5 fully supported in all modern browsers

ES6/ES2015 only partial support. IE and mobile is not so good.

ECMAScript 2015 still have very incomplete browser support today

Almost all tutorials are still in ES5
Older codebases will be written in ES5
Its easier to learn ES5 then update to ES6/ES2015
