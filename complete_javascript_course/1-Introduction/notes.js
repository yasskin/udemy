How to Ask for Help & The CodingHeroes Community

PLEASE READ THIS LECTURE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START THE ACTUAL COURSE. THANK YOU!

How to ask for help?
As you go through the course, you might have some questions about a specific topic, or get stuck in a coding lecture and need help. That sucks! And that's why I'm here to help :)

So if you have a question, a problem, or something else you want to share, you can use: 1) The course Q&A, or 2) The CodingHeroes chatroom.

1) Using the Official Course Q&A Section

To use the official course Q&A, please follow the following steps:

Start by spending some time trying to solve the problem on your own. This is very important for your learning process!
To find errors, compare your code with the downloadable code for each section.
Check if your question has already been asked before in the relevant lecture.
If you can’t solve the problem, the community is here to help!
If you have a small piece of code, please post it to the Q&A along with the question. For longer code, please post it to a JSBin and then share the link in the Q&A.
Explain your problem very specifically: that makes answering easier.
I will try to help you as soon as possible, or a fellow student will help you. Many students actually find that helping others helps themselves to get better and better at coding.

2) Using the CodingHeroes Chatroom

By signing up for this course, you automatically become a part of the CodingHeroes Community :)

We have an amazing chatroom where you can chat with other students in real time, ask for help and just hang out. It’s an amazing opportunity to create an active and amazing community around my courses!

So join the chatroom right now using this invite: https://discord.gg/0ocsLcmnIZqxMSYD.

My Design and Coding Resources
One thing that students love the most about my courses is my design and coding resources page.

It contains resources spread across 10 categories, and one of them is JavaScript. Some of the webpages that I show you during the course can be found right at the resources page.

So here is the link:

http://codingheroes.io/resources/

The resource page also gets regular updates. I'm always looking for new resources all over the internet, and so as soon as I find a couple new ones, I update the page to make it even better for you.
