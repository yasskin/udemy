# Handling User Input with Forms and Events

## Event Handlers

- Uncontrolled form components.

- Controlled elements.

### Flow

1. User types in input
2. Callback gets invoked
3. We call setState with the new value
4. Component rerenders
5. Input is told what its value is (coming from state)

### React World

- What's the value of the input right now? Source of data was inside HTML not React component.
- We don't want to store information in the HTML elements.
- We want to centralize the information inside the React side, not the DOM.
- Other JS frameworks store information in the DOM.
-

## What is 'this' used for in a class

- Instance of SearchBar
- "this" refers to the instance of the SearchBar

## How is the value of 'this' determined in a function?

```
class Car {
  setDriveSound(sound) {
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  drive() {
    return this.sound;
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.setDriveSound('vroom');
car.drive(); // 'vroom'

const honda = new Car();
honda.setDriveSound('put put');
honda.drive(); // 'put put'

const drive = car.drive

drive() // Cannot read property "drive" of undefined

```

'this' is equal to the 'car' or 'honda', whatever is to the left of the function ('.drive() in this case');

## How to solve this problem

```
class Car {

  // define the constructor, bind the function, overwrite the existing one
  constructor() {
    this.drive = this.drive.bind(this);
  }


  setDriveSound(sound) {
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  drive() {
    return this.sound;
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.setDriveSound('vroom');
car.drive(); // 'vroom'

const honda = new Car();
honda.setDriveSound('put put');
honda.drive(); // 'put put'

const drive = car.drive

drive() // Cannot read property "drive" of undefined

```
