# Section One

## A JavaScript class -- React components are made using either JS functions or classes

## JSX

- A dialect of JS. Determines the content, like normal HTML

## Event Handlers

## React is split into two separate libraries

1. 'React' knows what a component is and how to make components work together
2. 'ReactDOM' knows how to take a component and make it show up on the DOM

## Why Create React App

## Create-React-App Project

1. Src. Directory for the source code
2. Public. Static files - html, images, music
3. node_modules: dependencies that were installed
4. package.json - lists the dependencies and has some configuration
5. package-lock.json - records the exact version of dependencies we installed
6. README.md - directions on how to run the project
7. .gitignore file - lists the files that git should ignore

## Starting and Stopping a React App

- <control> + 'C'
- npm start or yarn start in project directory

## JS Module Systems

## Functional Components

## GitHub Repo

# Import vs Require

- ES2015 Modules uses the "Import" syntax
- `import React from 'react';`
- CommonJS Modules is a different state or rules
- `const React = require('react');`
