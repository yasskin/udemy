# Type Annotations and Type Inference

* Type Annotations: Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to
* Type Inference: TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

## JS Primitive Types
1. number
2. boolean
3. void
4. undefined
5. string
6. symbol
7. null

## JS Object Types
1. functions
2. arrays
3. classes
4. objects


// type inference
works when declare and initialize a variable on one line

## Type Annotations

* When to use:
* When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
* When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
* When a function return the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value

## The 'Any' Type

## Delayed Initialization
