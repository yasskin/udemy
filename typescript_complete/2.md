# What is a Type System?

## Course Goal

- understand basic types in TS
- function typing + annotations
- type definition files
- arrays in TS
- modules system
- classes refresher

## Type

- An easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has

- Types are just labels to describe the properties and methods a value has

- Every value in JavaScript has a type

## Types

- String : "hi there", "", 'Today is Monday'
- Number : .0002, -20, 40000000
- boolean : true, false
- Date : new Date();
- ToDo : { id: 1, completed: true, title: "Trash" } // defined by a tsc interface

## Two Categories of Types

1. Primitive Types: number, string, boolean, symbol, void, null, undefined
2. Object Types: function, arrays, classes, objects

- Why Two Categories?

- We can "trick" the typescript compiler with object types

Why do we care about types?

1. Types are used by the TS compiler to
2. Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
