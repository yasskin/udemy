# State

## Rules of State

1. Only usable with class components (with functional components with hooks)
2. You will confuse props with state (unfortunately)
3. 'State' is a JS object that contains data relative to a singular component
4. Updating 'state' on a component cause the component to (almost) instantly rerender
5. State must be initialized when a component is created
6. State can only be updated using the function 'setState'
