# Using Refs for DOM Access

1. Let the ImageCard render itself and its image
2. Reach into the DOM and figure out the height of the image
3. Set the image height on state on each image card to get the component to rerender
4. When rerendering, assign a grid-row-end to make sure the image takes up the appropriate space

## React Refs

- System that gives access to a single DOM element
  1. We create refs in the constructor function
  2. Assign them to instance variables on our class
  3. Then pass them a particular JSX element as a prop

Because Refs do not change, we don't need to link it up with state
